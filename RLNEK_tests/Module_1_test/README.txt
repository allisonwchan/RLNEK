###This is an example of RLNEK Module 1 prompts & inputs###
###This is meant to ensure RLNEK was installed correctly (DISCLAIMER: not actual receptor-ligand kinetics)###
###Please check your outputs to correspond to outputs in the outputs folder of Module_2_TEST###
###Note, when NOT for testing, always copy Module_1.py to the directory where Trackmate files are located###

###start by changing the operating directory in 'Module_1.py' --> os.chdir('/User/RLNEK_tests/Module_1_test')###
###Next, run script & follow prompts with described inputs below for testing###
###prompts precede ":" and user inputs follow ":"###
