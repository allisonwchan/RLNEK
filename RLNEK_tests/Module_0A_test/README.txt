###This is an example of the RLNEK Module 0A prompts & inputs###
###This module calculates applied tether/tensile force from flow rate in a given experimental system###
###This is meant to ensure RLNEK was installed correctly (DISCLAIMER: not actual receptor-ligand kinetics)###

###Run script & follow prompts with described inputs below for testing###
###prompts precede ":" and user inputs follow ":"###

Enter fluid viscosity (dyne-s/cm²): 6.92e-3

Enter cell/sphere radius (μm): 7.85

Enter critical distance (μm): 0.05

Enter receptor-ligand bond length (nm): 36

Enter flow chamber height (μm): 75

Enter flow chamber width (μm): 800

Enter flow rates (μL/hr), separated by commas and without new lines: 5, 10, 20

For Q = 5.000000 (μL/hr), force = 36.211474 pN
For Q = 10.000000 (μL/hr), force = 72.422948 pN
For Q = 20.000000 (μL/hr), force = 144.845897 pN
